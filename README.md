Parul's Flaskify API is a versatile API built with Flask that provides easy-to-use endpoints for palindrome checking and more. The main page offers a welcoming HTML interface, while the /is_palindrome/<string:n> endpoint checks if a given string is a palindrome and returns the result along with the server's IP address. This project showcases a practical application of Flask for web development and API creation.
